## Presentation for openSUSE Summit in Nashville, April 2019

This repo contains the source code for slides and demos presented at
[the openSUSE Summit in
Nashville](https://events.opensuse.org/conferences/oSSN19/program/proposals/2309),
on Saturday 6<sup>th</sup> April 2019.

It is based on
[a template by Adam Spiers](https://github.com/aspiers/presentation-template/)
which is in turn based on
[a template by Florian Haas](https://github.com/fghaas/presentation-template/)
which uses [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) (by
Hakim El-Hattab and contributors) as the underlying presentation
technology.
