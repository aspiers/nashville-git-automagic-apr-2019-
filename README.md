## Presentation for OpenStack PTG, 11th Sept 2018

This repo contains the source code for slides and demos presented at a
lunchtime lightning talk on 11th Sept 2018 at the [OpenStack PTG Denver
meetup](https://www.openstack.org/ptg).

It is based on
[a template by Adam Spiers](https://github.com/aspiers/presentation-template/)
which is in turn based on
[a template by Florian Haas](https://github.com/fghaas/presentation-template/)
which uses [`reveal.js`](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) (by
Hakim El-Hattab and contributors) as the underlying presentation
technology.
