# Problems with development

*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Difficult to predict what you'll be doing next
    *   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        Feature work?
    *   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        Bug fix?
    *   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
        Refactoring?
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Multi-tasking
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    We're human
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    We have to deal with other humans

<!-- .element: class="fragment" --> What does this mean when using `git`?

Note:
- We can't hope to conform to our own best practices 100% of the time
- Code review is extremely worthwhile, but responding to
  feedback can be a big time sink, especially when it involves
  rewriting history of many commits.

### Any ideas?

## Blame it on the tools!  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

*   Blame it on the tools!
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    No seriously, give us better tools
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    More agility
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Spot common workflows and automate
*   <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
    Aim for higher-level workflows

Note:
- git development is currently evolution rather than revolution
- Imagine a future IDE where you could drag and drop hunks
  between commits, and commits between branches.
